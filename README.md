Coins
=====

An introduction to packaging problems, designed to support creative maths.

Getting Started (Developers)
---

Install [NodeJs](http://nodjs.com) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), then:

```
git clone https://github.com/gmp26/Coins.git
cd Coins
npm install && bower install
grunt server
```

The third step downloads and compiles development dependencies so you will see
a lot of network traffic.

Chrome will open pointing to a copy of the animation at http://localhost:9000.

Notes
---

* `grunt server:dist` will create a publication ready, minified and optimised distribution in dist.
